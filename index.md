**Original Post from Student:**

Hey,

I'm working on this Java assignment that's supposed to make a stack. For some reason my push function isn't working. I've attached a screenshot of the output below. Any ideas on what might be causing this?

**Follow-up from TA:**

I see the problem. Could you try changing `addLast` to `addFirst`? That should make it work.

**Student's Follow-Up:**

Thanks it worked!

I learned how to make my task of running multiple commands easier using bash scripts. It has saved me a lot of time in running my tests for CSE 12 assignments.
